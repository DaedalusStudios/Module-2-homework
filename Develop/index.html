		<h2>About me</h3>
			<p>I'm a 43 year old geek who moved to Phoenix to follow a dream of having a good job.  It took several jobs to get there, but I have a pretty nice one.  Dream achieved.  Now I'm in a bootcamp to unlearn bad habits and form some new ones!</p>
			<p>I am real big into videogames, LARP, and camping.  I recently purchased a travel trailer so I can Glamp with the best of them.</p>

		<h2>Bootcamp</h3>
		<p>The bootcamp I'm doing is through ASU in partnership with edX.  My boss actually suggested edX after he heard I was taking a bootcamp, which was a neat coincidence.</p>
